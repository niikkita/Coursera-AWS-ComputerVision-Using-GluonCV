# Coursera-AWS-ComputerVision-Using-GluonCV
This repository will include some of my solutions to the Coursera course offered by AWS titled "AWS Computer Vision: Getting Started with GluonCV".

There are no programming exercises for modules 1 and 2, so it starts from 3 here.

This course provided me with an overview of Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning (ML) with Amazon Web Services (AWS), and how to build and train a CV model using the Apache MXNet and GluonCV toolkit. The course discusses artificial neural networks and other deep learning concepts, then walks through how to combine neural network building blocks into complete computer vision models and train them efficiently.
